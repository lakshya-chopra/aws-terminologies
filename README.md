5. **Block Storage** : This is used to store data in fixed size blocks that don't follow any hierarchial or directory like structure. These are usually used in SANs (Storage Area Networks) and allow multiple servers to access the blocks at the same time (shared access) as if the blocks are a part of a that server's own hard disk. Each block has a unique address that allows the server to access and (or) modify it.
